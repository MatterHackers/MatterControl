These files represent the translations of 'Master.txt'.  
The only file that is always up to date is 'Master.txt' and 
attempts to maintain it's order of string entries. So new strings
should appear at the bottom of that file.

There is a folder for each langage. The names of these folders 
match the ISO 639 standard which can be found at:
