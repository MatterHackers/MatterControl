However, if you've been printing for a while, you likely are very familiar with the limitations such as limited speeds due to limited planning capabilities, limited step generation, un-optimized acceleration/deceleration, limited resources for advanced kinematics processing, etc.</p>\r\n<p>While these limitations do not prevent you from achieving beautiful prints at standard 3D printing speeds, we wanted to find a smarter solution for faster and smoother printing. Enter the 32-bit SKR 1.4 Turbo board that comes with four stepper drivers!</p>",

With a faster CPU clock, more RAM and optimized firmware, 32-bit electronics significantly improve the planning ability of your printer. This means that the printer's \"brain\" can make itself move faster, more accurately, and efficiently plan its movements leading to faster, cleaner, and more accurate prints. Stepper Drivers are also installed with this upgrade for an even smoother, quieter, and more precise 3D printing experience.</p>\r\n<p>In our testing, using the same slice settings as well as the same firmware acceleration, we saw an average decrease in print time of over 32%. On some parts, there was nearly a 50% reduction in print time!</p>",
