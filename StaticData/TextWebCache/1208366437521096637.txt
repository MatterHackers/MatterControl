Suitable for a variety of applications, examples of everyday use cases can be found in the form of squeezable bottles, flip-top mint containers, car bumpers, toys, and so much more. Positive features associated with polypropylene include its robust resistance to chemicals, fatigue, high-temperature, and impact. This thermoplastic material is made up of hydrophobic molecules (molecules physically resistant to water), making it ideal for products that heavily rely on protection from moisture. With these qualities in mind, its no wonder polypropylene has caught the attention of 3D printing enthusiasts for prototyping purposes and even ready-to-use functional parts.</p></div>",

Each of these has their own set of advantages and disadvantages, but the biggest thing is that if your 3D printer doesn&rsquo;t already utilize one of these, there&rsquo;s some external cost involved in upgrading your printer to do more than one color or material in a print, unless you fake it.</span></p></div>",

However, like most 3D printing materials, there is a level of post-processing to bring out those qualities. With most materials, you need to do it by hand with some elbow grease, but with metallic filaments, you can leave a lot of that work to a rock tumbler.

Not many 3D printers had all-metal hotends that could support it, but those that did were able to print structural components using a much less temperamental material. Nowadays PETG has almost entirely replaced ABS as the \"structural-material of choice,\" with everything from end-use jigs, fixtures, and products to entire 3D printers being made using PETG.

Up until 2016, she was using typical cosplay materials for her builds; EVA foam, Kydex, wood, fabric, and leather. Once she was introduced to 3D printing by a friend, she was hooked! With her background in AutoCAD and <a href=\"https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/mattercontrol/sk/MKZGTDW6\">3D modeling</a>, she was able to transition into 3D printing to add another creative tool to her arsenal. Now, she primarily uses <a href=\"https://www.matterhackers.com/articles/finding-the-right-3d-modeling-software-for-you\">Fusion 360 and MeshMixer</a> to design the 3D models that she prints on her <a href=\"https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/ultimaker-2-3d-printer/sk/ME7R89S4\">Ultimaker 2+</a>.

Her most recent endeavor was producing masks and props for the schools production of the play, <em>The Lion King</em>.
