The AXIOM 20's sleek, fully enclosed design also offers an auto-leveling system, CoreXY drive system, and two high quality all-metal JrX Hotends.</p>\n<p>Before each print, the four-point print bed leveling system will routinely calibrate the bed to guarantee layer height perfection. Once it finishes, the AXIOM 20 will maintain these settings throughout the entire print process. AXIOM 20 uses the cutting edge CoreXY motion control system to ensure a more accelerated process and precise management of the print head. The\u00a0Z-axis also has a precision ball screw to provide high repeatability, zero backlash, and extreme precision.</p>\n<p>The AW3D AXIOM 20 has a huge build volume of 12.5\"x12\"x20\", making it the tallest Dual Extruder printer in it's class. Its fully encased design gives its standard heated bed a reliable warm environment making it a perfect place to print grand, high resolution prints at layer heights as low as 40 microns.</p>\n<p>If you have been looking for a printer that can print high resolution prototypes, products, or molds that require 2 colors or soluble support material, then this is the printer for you!</p>\n<h2>What's In the Box?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>AW3D AXIOM 20 3D Printer</li>\n<li>0.50mm\u00a0Jrx High Definition Nozzles</li>\n<li>1 - Double Sided Flex-resistant Glass</li>\n<li>1 - 2oz bottle of Wolfbite Premium Adhesive Solution</li>\n<li>2 - 1kg spool of ABS filament (3 mm)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why Buy From MatterHackers</h2>\n<p>At MatterHackers we pride ourselves on offering friendly service, advice and support.
