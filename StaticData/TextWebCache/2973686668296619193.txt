If you are new to 3D printing, this is the machine for you. The HDL is designed to cater to beginners, as well as their growing passion for printing. This particular printer contains the same triumphant qualities as other sophisticated printers, but it has the ability to add other features when your printing becomes more advanced. Some of the other features include a&nbsp;jam-resistant JRx hot end, or a&nbsp;dual hot-end, which has the ability to print engineering-grade specialty filaments, like Polycarbonate and Bridge Nylon.</p>\r\n<p>Your large imagination will never be stifled with the HDL. It has a HUGE build volume, so you will have plenty of space to print your creations. The HDL rivals competitors with a&nbsp;build envelope of 1,100 cubic inches (12&rdquo; x 8&rdquo; x 11&rdquo;), which is three to four times larger than similarly priced printers.</p>\r\n<p>The Airwolf 3D HDL has a layer to layer resolution of 0.08mm - this provides a very detailed and accurate print. With this precision, your printed objects will look exactly how you envisioned them! &nbsp;The HDL prints with many filaments, including: Biodegradable PLA, Soft PLA, LayBrick, LayWood, BronzeFill, TPE, and TPU.</p>",

Before shipping out your printer, the team at Airwolf uses each new printer to print parts for another 3D printer for 15 hours before boxing it up for you to enjoy. You'll notice several 3D printed parts on every Airwolf model. Each of the parts you see was printed on someone else's 3D printer before they ever pulled it out of the box. Besides offering a warm and fuzzy pay it forward type feeling, the practical truth is that printing with each machine for 15 hours before shipment ensures a level of quality assurance that can't otherwise be matched. As a result when your Airwolf arrives at your door you can be guaranteed it is leveled and fully calibrated. Furthermore, because of the sturdy design of each Airwolf, they stay in alignment very well meaning you rarely need to re-calibrate.</p>\n<p><span>Why Buy from MatterHackers</span></p>\n<p>At MatterHackers we pride ourselves on offering friendly service, advice and support.
