Print Leveling allows MatterControl to figure out the tilt or angle of the bed. Using this information when printing, MatterControl actively raises and lowers the Z axis to make sure that the printed part matches the tilt bed and will always remain correctly above it. This process ensures that the print remains level regardless of the unevenness of the bed.

Long story short, no matter how tilted your bed is, Automatic Print Leveling will ensure that your print will match it perfectly.

## Enable/Disable

On the Controls page you can go into Printer Calibration to enable Print Leveling.

Once you have gone into the Printer Setup & Calibration page you can Run Print Leveling to measure your printer's bed plane.

A step-by-step instruction wizard will open and walk you through the calibration process with clear, easy-to-follow instructions.

The only thing you will need is a sheet of standard paper.

The software will ask you to help it measure several points on your bed and when completed Print Leveling will automatically be turned on and ready to help. The whole process is very easy and will take about 3 to 5 minutes.

You will then have the option to run the calibration again or turn it on or off.
