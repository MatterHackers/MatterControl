The experts at MatterHackers are here to help by providing the training and resources you need to succeed in the early stages of your 3D printing journey and set you on the path to continued growth. With Launchpad, we provide everything needed for your first completed print on your new Ultimaker S3 or S5 3D printer. In addition to the machine itself, Launchpad includes a guided setup and calibration process to get you up and running. The guide takes you through unboxing, software setup, machine calibration, all the way to your first completed 3D print. If you get stuck along the way, or have additional questions not covered in the guide, Launchpad includes an hour video conference time with one of our application engineers to go over anything from the guide you may want more discussion on or to look at your next steps in 3D printing.</p>",
